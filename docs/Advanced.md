# Advanced fastlane

## Passing Parameters

To pass parameters from the command line to your lane, use the following syntax:

```
fastlane [lane] key:value key2:value2

fastlane deploy submit:false build_number:24
```

To access those values, change your lane decleration to also include `|options|`

```ruby
lane :deploy do |options|
  ...
  if options[:submit]
    # Only when submit is true
  end
  ...
  increment_build_number(build_number: options[:build_number])
  ...
end
```

## Switching lanes

To switch lanes while executing a lane, use the following code:

```ruby
lane :deploy do |options|
  ...
  build(release: true) # that's the important bit
  hockey
  ...
end

lane :staging do |options|
  ...
  build # it also works when you don't pass parameters
  hockey
  ...
end

lane :build do |options|
  scheme = (options[:release] ? "Release" : "Staging")
  ipa(scheme: scheme)
end
```

`fastlane` takes care of all the magic for you. You can call lanes of the same platform or a general lane outside of the `platform` definition.

Passing parameters is optional.

## Returning values
Additionally, you can retrieve the return value. In Ruby, the last line of the `lane` definition is the return value. Here is an example:

```ruby
lane :deploy do |options|
  value = calculate(value: 3)
  puts value # => 5
end

lane :calculate do |options|
  ...
  2 + options[:value] # the last line will always be the return value
end
```

## Shell values
You can get value from shell commands:
```ruby
output_of_command = sh("pod update")
```

## Importing another Fastfile

Within your `Fastfile` you can import another `Fastfile`. 

```ruby
import "../GeneralFastfile"

override_lane :from_general do
  ...
end
```

You should import the other `Fastfile` on the top above your lane declarations. When defining a new lane `fastlane` will make sure to not run into any name conflicts. If you want to overwrite an existing lane (from the imported one), use the `override_lane` keyword. 


## Environment Variables
You can define environment variables in a `.env` or `.env.default` file in the same directory as your `Fastfile`. Environment variables are loading using [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv). Here's an example.

```
WORKSPACE=YourApp.xcworkspace
HOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN=your-hockey-api-token
```

`fastlane` also has a `--env` option that allows loading of environment specific `dotenv` files. `.env` and `.env.default` will be loaded before environment specific `dotenv` files are loaded. The naming convention for environment specific `dotenv` files is `.env.<environment>`

For example, `fastlane <lane-name> --env development` will load `.env`, `.env.default`, and `.env.development`

## Lane Context

The different actions can *communicate* with each other using a shared hash. You can access them in your lanes with the following code.

Replace `VARIABLE_NAME_HERE` with any of the following.

```ruby
lane_context[SharedValues::LANE_NAME]                 # The name of the current lane (stays the same when switching lanes)
lane_context[SharedValues::BUILD_NUMBER]              # Generated by `increment_build_number`
lane_context[SharedValues::SNAPSHOT_SCREENSHOTS_PATH] # Generated by `snapshot`
lane_context[SharedValues::PRODUCE_APPLE_ID]          # The Apple ID of the newly created app
lane_context[SharedValues::IPA_OUTPUT_PATH]           # Generated by `ipa`
lane_context[SharedValues::DSYM_OUTPUT_PATH]          # Generated by `ipa`
lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_PROFILE_PATH]         # Generated by `sigh`
lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]                 # The UDID of the generated provisioning profile
lane_context[SharedValues::HOCKEY_DOWNLOAD_LINK]      # Generated by `hockey`
lane_context[SharedValues::DEPLOYGATE_URL]            # Generated by `deploygate`
lane_context[SharedValues::DEPLOYGATE_APP_REVISION]   # Integer, generated by `deploygate`
lane_context[SharedValues::DEPLOYGATE_APP_INFO]       # Hash, generated by `deploygate`
````

To get information about the available lane variables, run `fastlane action [action_name]`.

## Private lanes

Sometimes you might have a lane that is used from different lanes, for example:

```ruby
lane :production do
  ...
  build(release: true)
  appstore # Deploy to the AppStore
  ...
end

lane :beta do
  ...
  build(release: false)
  crashlytics # Distribute to testers
  ...
end

lane :build do |options|
  ...
  ipa
  ...
end
```

It probably doesn't make sense to execute the `build` lane directly using `fastlane build`. You can hide this lane using

```ruby
private_lane :build do |options|
  ...
end
```

This will hide the lane from:

- `fastlane lanes`
- `fastlane list`
- `fastlane docs`

And also, you can't call the private lane using `fastlane build`.

The resulting private lane can only be called from another lane using the lane switching technology.

## Hide the `fastlane` folder

Just rename the folder to `.fastlane` in case you don't want it to be visible in the Finder.

## Load own actions from external folder

Add this to the top of your `Fastfile`.

```ruby
actions_path '../custom_actions_folder/'
```

## The Appfile

The `Appfile` stores useful information that are used across all `fastlane` tools like your *Apple ID* or the application *Bundle Identifier*, to deploy your lanes faster and tailored on your project needs. 

By default an Appfile looks like:

```ruby
app_identifier "net.sunapps.1" # The bundle identifier of your app
apple_id "felix@krausefx.com" # Your Apple email address

# You can uncomment the lines below and add your own 
# team selection in case you're in multiple teams
# team_name "Felix Krause"
# team_id "Q2CBPJ58CA"
```

If your project has different bundle identifiers per environment (i.e. beta, app store), you can define that by using `for_platform` and/or `for_lane` block declaration. 

```ruby
app_identifier "net.sunapps.1"
apple_id "felix@krausefx.com"
team_id "Q2CBPJ58CC"

for_lane "ios beta" do
  app_identifier "net.sunapps.1.beta"
end

for_lane "ios enterprise" do
  app_identifier "enterprise.com"
end

for_platform :ios do
  team_id '123' # for all iOS related things
  for_lane :test do
    app_identifier 'com.app.test'
  end
end
```

You only have to prefix with `ios` if you're using `platform :ios do` in your `Fastfile`.

`fastlane` will always use the lane specific value if given, otherwise fall back to the value on the top of the file. Therefore, while driving the `:beta` lane, this configuration is loaded:

```ruby
app_identifier "net.sunapps.1.beta"
apple_id "felix@krausefx.com"
team_id "Q2CBPJ58CC"
```

## Skip update check when launching `fastlane`

You can set the environment variable `FASTLANE_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK` to skip the update check.
